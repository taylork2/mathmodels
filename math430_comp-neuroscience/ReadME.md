# MATH430 Analytical and Computational Neuroscience 

Prof. Rostein

Mathematical models for biophysical mechanisms that underlie physiological functions of single neurons and synapses. Topics include voltage-dependent channel gating mechanisms, the Hodgkin-Huxley model for membrane excitability, repetitive and burst firing, nerve impulse propagation in axons and dendrites, single- and multi-compartmental modeling, synaptic transmission, calcium handling dynamics and calcium dependent currents and processes.
